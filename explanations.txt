Import the necessary libraries:

gradio is used for creating the user interface.
numpy is used for numerical operations.
random is used to generate random numbers.
spaces is a library for managing resources like GPUs.
torch is a library for tensor computations.
DiffusionPipeline is a class from the diffusers library that allows us to use the FLUX.1-schnell model for text-to-image generation.
Set the data type to torch.bfloat16 and the device to "cuda" if it's available, otherwise "cpu".

Load the FLUX.1-schnell model from Hugging Face and move it to the specified device.

Define some constants: MAX_SEED is the maximum value for the seed, and MAX_IMAGE_SIZE is the maximum size for the generated image.

Define the infer function, which takes a prompt, seed, randomize_seed, width, height, and num_inference_steps as inputs. This function generates an image based on the input prompt using the FLUX.1-schnell model and returns the image and the seed used.

Define a list of example prompts related to marketing.

Define some CSS styles for the user interface.

Define the footer as an HTML string.

Create a gr.Blocks object with the specified CSS styles and theme.

Inside the gr.Blocks object, create a gr.Column object with the specified element ID.

Add a gr.Markdown object with the title and description of the app.

Create a gr.Row object containing a gr.Text object for the prompt input and a gr.Button object for running the inference.

Add a gr.Image object for displaying the generated image.

Create an gr.Accordion object containing advanced settings for the inference, such as the seed, randomize seed, width, height, and number of inference steps.

Add a gr.Examples object containing the example prompts and their corresponding generated images.

Add the footer to the user interface using a gr.HTML object.

Define the behavior of the app when the run button is clicked or the prompt is submitted using the gr.on function.

Launch the app using the launch function.
