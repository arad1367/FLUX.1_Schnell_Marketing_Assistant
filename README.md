## Installation

### Local installation

* To install the app locally, you'll need to have Python 3.6 or higher and pip installed. You'll also need a GPU with CUDA support to run the app efficiently (You can use google colab if you have not GPU in your local machine).

* First, clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/arad1367/FLUX.1_Schnell_Marketing_Assistant.git`


* Then, navigate to the repository directory and install the required dependencies:
`cd your-repo`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Finally, you can run the app with the following command:
`python app.py`


* If you don't have a GPU available, you can still run the app, but it may be slower.

### Hosting the app on Hugging Face

* Hugging Face Spaces is a platform that allows you to host and share your apps with others. To host your app on Hugging Face Spaces, you'll first need to create a Hugging Face account and then follow these steps:

- 1. Create a new Space on Hugging Face Spaces: https://huggingface.co/new-space
- 2. Upload your `app.py` and `requirements.txt` file to the Space. You can do this by clicking the "Upload files" button and selecting the `app.py` file.
- 3. Once your app is deployed, you'll be given a URL that you can share with others to access your app.
